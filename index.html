      <h2>College Admissions Are Stressful</h2>
      <p>“For all the institutions analyzed, there were nearly 4.9 million total applications in 2002, or about four for every student who ended up enrolling somewhere. By 2017, the total number of applications had more than doubled to almost 10.2 million, or 6.8 per enrolled student” - Pew Research</p>
      <p>Students are applying to more and more schools primarily due to the uncertainty they have in regards to being accepted to their target schools. This is a incredibly large amount of money lost for the student and their family, due to the fact that the student can only attend one school.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Our Solution?</h2>
      <h3>The College Acceptance Predictor</h3>
      <p>Using Machine Learning algorithms,  we can theoretically predict to a decent degree of accuracy the chances of a student being accepted into any given college.</p>
      <p>The Machine Learning algorithms would take into account: </p>
      <p>SAT, ACT, GPA, Ethnicity, Gender, In State/ Out State Status, Domestic / International Status, Private / Public School (with more features in the works)</p>
      <p>These are all important facts of a person that get taken into account in the college admissions process.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of admissions acceptance rate calculators, but they usually only take into account SAT/ACT and GPA; therefore, they are not very accurate.</p>
